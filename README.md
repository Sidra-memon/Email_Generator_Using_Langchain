# ðŸ“§ Email_Generator_Using_Langchain
This tool is a cold email generator designed specifically for service companies, using Groq, Langchain, and Streamlit. Users can input the URL of a company's careers page, and the tool extracts job listings from that page. It then generates personalized cold emails that include relevant portfolio links sourced from a vector database, tailored to the specific job descriptions.
